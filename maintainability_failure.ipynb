    "For Part 3, I created two versions of the same data file to show how file formats become hard to maintain over time. In the first version, each line uses the format ke=value, so my parser reads each line and splits on \"=\" to get the key and value. In the second version, the structure changed, the separator changed to \":\" and new fields were added, but the parsing code did not change. Because of that, the program crashes with a ValueError when it tries to split a line that no longer contains \"=\". This becomes error-prone because a small, \"reasonable\" format change breaks older code immediatley, adn there is no built-in schema or version label in a plain file to warn you that the format is different. Future developers get stuck either hunting down why the parser broke or adding more and more special-case rules for each format, which makes the code harder to understand, test, and modify safely."

    "**Key question answer:** This design fails future developers beacuse the file format can change silently and every reader of the file has to guess the format and update their code manually."
